# ADR 007: Use of Next.js for Frontend Development

**Status:** Approved

## Context
As part of our migration to a React-based frontend, we needed to choose a framework that would provide a robust foundation for building a scalable and performant web application.

## Decision
We decided to adopt **Next.js** as our React framework for frontend development in Omniscope.

## Alternatives Considered
We considered using plain React with a custom setup, as well as other React-based frameworks like Gatsby. However, Next.js offered the best balance of features, performance, and developer experience for our needs.

## Consequences
### Positive:
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Next.js provides built-in server-side rendering, improving initial load times and SEO.
- **Routing**: Next.js has a file-system based routing, which simplifies navigation management.
- **API Routes**: Next.js allows for easy creation of API endpoints, which can be useful for certain functionalities.
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting for faster page loads.
- **App Directory**: Next.js 13+ features like the app directory structure and server components provide improved performance and developer experience.

### Negative:
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to learn Next.js specific concepts and best practices.
- **Opinionated Structure**: Next.js has certain conventions that might not align with all developers' preferences.

## Implementation
- The frontend application structure follows Next.js conventions, with pages defined in the `app` directory.
- We utilize Next.js's built-in features like server components and client components where appropriate.
- Components are organized in a modular structure under the `components` directory.
- Next.js API routes are used for certain server-side functionalities.
