# ADR 002: Adoption of Pydantic for API Contract Validation
**Status:** Approved

## Context
To improve the reliability and maintainability of our API contracts, we identified a need for a tool that ensures automatic mapping of contract changes and enhances developer productivity through features like code completion. Prior to this, our team was directly manipulating JSON in API responses, which proved to be error-prone and difficult to maintain.

## Decision
We have decided to adopt **Pydantic** for validating API contracts and facilitating the development process. Pydantic allows us to define data models with strong typing and validation, automatically handling contract changes and reducing the likelihood of errors in data manipulation.

## Alternatives Considered
Before moving to Pydantic, we handled API responses directly with JSON. However, this approach led to frequent errors and increased the complexity of maintaining the API. The absence of built-in validation and typing in JSON processing made it a less reliable option compared to Pydantic.

## Consequences
### Positive:
- **Improved Reliability**: Pydantic's strong typing and validation mechanisms significantly reduce errors in API contract handling.
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Features like code completion streamline the development process, making it easier for developers to work with API contracts.
- **Reduced Maintenance Costs**: Although the initial development effort may increase, the long-term benefits of easier maintenance and fewer errors outweigh this cost.

### Negative:
- **Development Workflow Impact**: The generation of Pydantic classes can slow down the development process. However, this is mitigated by leveraging LLMs (Large Language Models) to facilitate the generation of these classes.
- **Increased Initial Development Costs**: The need to create and manage Pydantic models introduces additional work, but this is balanced by the anticipated reduction in maintenance efforts.
