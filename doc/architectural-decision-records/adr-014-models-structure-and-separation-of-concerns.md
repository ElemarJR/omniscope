# ADR 014: Models Structure and Separation of Concerns

**Status:** Approved

## Context
As our application grew in complexity, we needed a clear structure for our models and a well-defined separation of concerns between the data processing and API layers. This was necessary to improve maintainability, scalability, and testability of our codebase.

## Decision
We have decided to implement a layered architecture for our models and enforce a strict separation of concerns between the models and API layers.

### Models Structure
We have organized our models into the following layers:

1. **Syntactic Layer**: Handles raw data structures and basic data manipulation.
2. **Semantic Layer**: Provides meaning and context to the syntactic data, implementing business logic.
3. **Domain Layer**: Represents core business entities and their relationships.
4. **Datasets Layer**: Manages collections of data and provides methods for data access and manipulation.
5. **Analytics Layer**: Implements complex calculations and data analysis using dataclasses for structured data representation.

### Decorator Patterns
We've implemented several decorators to enhance functionality:
- `@cache`: For performance optimization through caching
- `@c4_external_system`: For documenting and managing external system integrations

### Data Validation
Pydantic is used extensively across different layers:
- Model validation at the domain layer
- Input validation at the API layer
- Data transformation and serialization between layers

## Consequences
### Positive:
- **Improved Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
- **Better Testability**: Business logic in model layers is easier to unit test.
- **Enhanced Scalability**: The layered approach allows for easier refactoring and extension of functionality.
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic provides robust type checking and validation.
- **Performance Optimization**: Cache decorators improve response times for frequently accessed data.

### Negative:
- **Initial Development Overhead**: Implementing this structure requires more upfront planning and development time.
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand the various layers and patterns.

## Implementation
- Model layers are strictly separated with clear interfaces
- Decorators are used consistently for cross-cutting concerns
- Pydantic models define the contract between layers
- Analytics models use dataclasses for efficient data structures
