# ADR 011: Adoption of TypeScript

**Status:** Approved

## Context
As our frontend codebase grew in complexity, we needed a way to improve code quality, catch errors early, and enhance developer productivity.

## Decision
We decided to adopt TypeScript for our frontend development.

## Alternatives Considered
We considered continuing with plain JavaScript or using Flow for static typing. However, TypeScript's robust ecosystem and strong integration with React and Next.js made it the preferred choice.

## Consequences
### Positive:
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript helps catch type-related errors at compile-time.
- **Improved Tooling**: Better autocomplete, refactoring tools, and IDE support.
- **Self-Documenting Code**: Types serve as a form of documentation.
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Easier to understand and refactor code, especially in large codebases.

### Negative:
- **Learning Curve**: Developers unfamiliar with TypeScript will need time to learn it.
- **Build Step**: TypeScript requires a compilation step, which can slightly increase build times.

## Implementation
- All new React components and utility functions are written in TypeScript.
- Existing JavaScript files are gradually migrated to TypeScript.
- TypeScript is configured to work with Next.js and our other tools and libraries.
