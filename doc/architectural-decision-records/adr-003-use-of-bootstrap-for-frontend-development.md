# ADR 003: Adoption of Bootstrap for Frontend Development
**Status:** Obsolete

## Context
To streamline frontend development for programmers without prior experience in this area, we identified the need for a framework that simplifies the process of creating consistent and responsive user interfaces. The adoption of Bootstrap, along with the dash-bootstrap-components library, was considered to facilitate this process.

## Decision
We have decided to adopt **Bootstrap** for frontend development, leveraging the **dash-bootstrap-components** library to integrate Bootstrap components into our Dash applications. This approach was chosen because it simplifies the layout process and enables the team to develop efficient interfaces more quickly.

## Alternatives Considered
Before adopting Bootstrap, we considered using only the default components provided by the Dash library. While these components are efficient, they proved challenging to layout effectively, leading to a more complex and time-consuming development process.

## Consequences
### Positive:
- **Simplified Development Process**: Bootstrap and dash-bootstrap-components significantly reduce the complexity of frontend development, enabling the team to create consistent and responsive interfaces with less effort.
- **Enhanced Developer Productivity**: The team can now focus on functionality and efficiency rather than struggling with layout issues, resulting in faster development cycles.

### Negative:
- **Aesthetic Trade-offs**: While the use of Bootstrap accelerates the development process, it has delayed the focus on aesthetic refinement. This could lead to a need for future adjustments to improve the visual appeal of the interfaces.
- **Potential Design Uniformity**: Heavy reliance on Bootstrap might result in less flexibility in design, making it harder to differentiate the visual style of the application from other Bootstrap-based projects.

## Update
This decision has been superseded by ADR-009, which details the use of a custom UI component library with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion. ADR-009 has since been superseded by a newer ADR describing the adoption of Catalyst as the main framework for interface development.
