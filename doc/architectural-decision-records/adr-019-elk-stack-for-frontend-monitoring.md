# ADR 019: ELK Stack for Frontend Monitoring

**Status:** Approved

## Context
As our frontend application grew in complexity, we needed a robust solution for monitoring user interactions, performance metrics, and application errors. We needed to understand how users interact with our application and quickly identify and diagnose issues in production.

## Decision
We have decided to implement the **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for frontend monitoring and logging, with custom middleware for enhanced logging capabilities.

### Monitoring Strategy
1. **User Interactions**:
   - Page views and navigation patterns
   - Feature usage analytics
   - User session tracking
   - Performance metrics (Core Web Vitals)

2. **Error Tracking**:
   - Client-side errors and exceptions
   - API request failures
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - React rendering issues

3. **Analytics Integration**:
   - Integration with business analytics
   - User behavior analysis
   - Performance impact on business metrics

## Alternatives Considered
- Google Analytics (limited technical insights)
- Sentry (focused mainly on error tracking)
- Custom logging solution (too much maintenance overhead)
- New Relic (cost considerations)

## Consequences
### Positive:
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Full visibility into frontend behavior and performance
- **Real-time Insights**: Immediate access to user interaction data
- **Flexible Querying**: Powerful search and analysis capabilities through Kibana
- **Integration**: Easy integration with existing backend ELK infrastructure
- **Custom Dashboards**: Ability to create specific visualizations for different stakeholders

### Negative:
- **Implementation Overhead**: Required setup of logging middleware and configurations

## Implementation
- Custom middleware for structured logging
- Integration with React components for automatic event tracking
- Error boundary implementation for React error catching
- Performance monitoring through Web Vitals API
- Custom Kibana dashboards for different monitoring aspects
