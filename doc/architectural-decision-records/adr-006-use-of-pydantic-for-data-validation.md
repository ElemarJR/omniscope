# ADR 006: Use of Pydantic for Data Validation

**Status:** Approved

## Context
With the migration to a GraphQL-based architecture, we identified the need for a robust solution for data validation and schema definition in the Python backend.

## Decision
We decided to adopt **Pydantic** for data validation and model definition in the Omniscope backend. This decision was made to ensure data integrity, facilitate serialization/deserialization, and improve the development experience.

## Alternatives Considered
We considered using manual validation or other data validation libraries, but Pydantic stood out due to its seamless integration with Python type hints and its ability to automatically generate GraphQL schemas.

## Consequences
### Positive:
- **Robust Validation**: Pydantic provides strong, type-based data validation.
- **GraphQL Integration**: Facilitates the generation of GraphQL schemas from Pydantic models.
- **Improved Code Quality**: Encourages the use of type hints, improving code readability and maintainability.

### Negative:
- **Learning Curve**: Developers unfamiliar with Pydantic will need to learn its concepts and practices.
- **Performance Overhead**: In some cases, data validation may add a small performance overhead.

## Implementation
- Pydantic models are used to define the data structure throughout the backend.
- Integration with the GraphQL schema is done using Pydantic models as the basis for GraphQL types.
