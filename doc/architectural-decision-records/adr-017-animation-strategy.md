# ADR 017: Animation Strategy

**Status:** Approved

## Context
Our application requires various types of animations to enhance user experience and provide visual feedback. We needed a consistent approach to implementing animations across the application.

## Decision
We have decided to use a combination of **Framer Motion** and **React Spring** for animations, with clear guidelines on when to use each library.

### Usage Guidelines
1. **Framer Motion**:
   - Page transitions
   - Component mount/unmount animations
   - Gesture-based interactions
   - Complex animation sequences

2. **React Spring**:
   - Number transitions
   - Simple interpolations
   - Performance-critical animations
   - Physics-based animations

## Alternatives Considered
- Using CSS animations only (limited functionality)
- Using a single animation library (would miss benefits of each)
- React Transition Group (less feature-rich)

## Consequences
### Positive:
- **Flexibility**: Each library's strengths can be leveraged appropriately
- **Performance**: React Spring for performance-critical animations
- **Developer Experience**: Declarative animation APIs
- **Maintainability**: Consistent animation patterns across the application

### Negative:
- **Bundle Size**: Including two animation libraries increases bundle size
- **Complexity**: Developers need to know when to use each library
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn two different animation APIs

## Implementation
- Standard animation configurations are defined in theme constants
- Framer Motion is used for layout animations and transitions
- React Spring handles number animations and physics-based interactions
- Animation components are abstracted into reusable hooks where possible
