# ADR 020: Minimal Frontend Processing Strategy

**Status:** Approved

## Context
As our application grew in complexity, we observed that significant data processing in the frontend could lead to performance issues, inconsistent business logic implementation, and harder maintenance. We needed to establish clear guidelines about where data processing should occur in our architecture.

## Decision
We have decided to implement a **Minimal Frontend Processing** strategy, where APIs must provide data in the exact shape required for frontend rendering, minimizing any data transformation or business logic in the frontend layer.

### Key Principles
1. **API Response Structure**:
   - Data should be returned in the exact structure needed for rendering
   - Calculations and data aggregations should happen server-side
   - GraphQL queries should be designed to match component data requirements

2. **Frontend Responsibilities**:
   - Focus on presentation logic and user interactions
   - Handle UI state management
   - Manage user input validation
   - Handle client-side routing

3. **Backend Responsibilities**:
   - All business logic implementation
   - Data aggregation and transformation
   - Complex calculations
   - Data validation and sanitization

## Alternatives Considered
- Hybrid approach with shared business logic (leads to duplication)
- Frontend-heavy processing (performance and consistency issues)
- Client-side data transformation (inconsistent results)

## Consequences
### Positive:
- **Better Performance**: Reduced client-side processing overhead
- **Consistency**: Business logic remains centralized in the backend
- **Maintainability**: Clearer separation of concerns
- **Reliability**: Less chance of inconsistent calculations
- **Caching**: Better caching opportunities at API level

### Negative:
- **API Complexity**: More specific endpoints/queries needed
- **Development Time**: Initial API development may take longer
- **API Flexibility**: Less flexible for varying frontend needs

## Implementation
- GraphQL queries designed to match component data requirements
- Backend resolvers handle all data transformation
- Frontend components receive ready-to-render data
- Clear documentation of data contracts between frontend and backend
- Performance monitoring to ensure strategy effectiveness
