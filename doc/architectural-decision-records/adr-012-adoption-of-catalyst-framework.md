# ADR 012: Adoption of Catalyst Framework for UI Development

**Status:** Approved

## Context
As our application grew in complexity, we needed a more robust and consistent approach to UI development. Our previous custom UI component library, while flexible, required significant maintenance and didn't provide all the features we needed for rapid development.

## Decision
We have decided to adopt the Catalyst framework as our main UI development framework for Omniscope.

## Alternatives Considered
We previously used a custom UI component library with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion (as described in ADR-009). We also considered other popular UI frameworks such as Material-UI and Ant Design.

## Consequences
### Positive:
- **Consistency**: Catalyst provides a consistent design language across our application.
- **Rapid Development**: Pre-built components and utilities allow for faster development.
- **Accessibility**: Catalyst components are built with accessibility in mind.
- **Integration**: Catalyst is designed to work well with our existing tech stack (React, Next.js).
- **Customization**: While providing a consistent base, Catalyst still allows for customization to fit our specific needs.

### Negative:
- **Learning Curve**: The team will need to learn how to use Catalyst effectively.
- **Dependency**: We become more reliant on the Catalyst ecosystem and its update cycle.
- **Migration Effort**: Existing components will need to be migrated to use Catalyst.

## Implementation
- Gradually replace custom UI components with Catalyst components.
- Update our design system to align with Catalyst's principles.
- Provide training and resources for the team to learn Catalyst.
- Establish guidelines for when to use Catalyst components vs. custom solutions.
