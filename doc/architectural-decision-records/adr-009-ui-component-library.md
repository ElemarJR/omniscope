# ADR 009: UI Component Library

**Status:** Approved

## Context
As we developed the frontend for Omniscope, we needed a consistent and efficient approach to building UI components.

## Decision
We decided to use a combination of custom UI components, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Framer Motion for animations.

## Alternatives Considered
We considered using off-the-shelf component libraries like Material-UI or Ant Design, but decided that a custom approach would give us more flexibility and control over the design.

## Consequences
### Positive:
- **Customization**: Custom components allow for a unique look and feel tailored to our needs.
- **Performance**: Tailwind CSS provides efficient, utility-first styling.
- **Animations**: Framer Motion enables smooth, performant animations.
- **Consistency**: A custom component library ensures consistency across the application.

### Negative:
- **Development Time**: Creating and maintaining custom components requires more initial development time.
- **Learning Curve**: Team members need to learn Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion.

## Implementation
- Custom UI components are created in the `components/ui` and `components/catalyst` directories.
- Tailwind CSS is used for styling throughout the application.
- Framer Motion is used for implementing animations where needed.
