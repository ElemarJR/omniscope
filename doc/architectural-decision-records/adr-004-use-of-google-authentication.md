# ADR 004: Adoption of Google Authentication for Users
**Status:** Approved

## Context
EximiaCo uses Google Suite as its primary platform for various business operations. To streamline the management of user authentication, the decision was made to leverage Googleâ€™s authentication services. This approach reduces the overhead associated with user management by delegating authentication responsibilities to the Google platform.

## Decision
We have decided to adopt **Google Authentication** for managing user access to our systems. This decision was driven by the integration of Google Suite within EximiaCo, allowing for a more efficient and centralized management of user credentials.

## Alternatives Considered
Before moving to Google Authentication, we used **Cognito** for a more simplified user management experience. However, we encountered difficulties in efficiently integrating Cognito with our Dash/Flask workflow, which led us to consider Google Authentication as a better fit for our needs.

## Consequences
### Positive:
- **Efficient Authentication Control**: By using Google Authentication, we benefit from robust and well-supported authentication mechanisms, reducing the administrative burden and enhancing security.
- **Seamless Integration with Google Suite**: The adoption aligns with our existing use of Google Suite, creating a more cohesive environment for both users and administrators.

### Negative:
- **Lack of Authorization Mechanisms**: While Google Authentication provides strong authentication capabilities, we currently lack mechanisms for managing user authorization within our system, which will need to be addressed separately.
