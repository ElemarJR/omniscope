# ADR 010: State Management Strategy

**Status:** Approved

## Context
With the adoption of React for our frontend, we needed to decide on an efficient state management strategy.

## Decision
We decided to use a combination of React hooks for local state management and Apollo Client for global state management and data fetching.

## Alternatives Considered
We considered using Redux or MobX for global state management but found that the combination of React hooks and Apollo Client met our needs without additional complexity.

## Consequences
### Positive:
- **Simplicity**: React hooks provide a simple and intuitive way to manage local state.
- **GraphQL Integration**: Apollo Client seamlessly integrates with our GraphQL backend.
- **Caching**: Apollo Client provides efficient caching mechanisms out of the box.

### Negative:
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand Apollo Client's caching and state management patterns.
- **Potential Complexity**: For very complex state scenarios, this approach might become harder to manage compared to a more centralized state management solution.

## Implementation
- React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) are used for managing component-level state.
- Apollo Client is used for managing global state and handling GraphQL queries and mutations.
- Custom hooks are created where needed to encapsulate complex state logic.
