# ADR 015: Analytics Architecture

**Status:** Approved

## Context
Our system requires complex analytics capabilities with different types of analysis (timeliness, performance, approved vs actual hours). We needed a structured approach to handle these analytics requirements efficiently.

## Decision
We have decided to implement a dedicated analytics architecture using dataclasses for structured data representation and clear separation of different types of analysis.

### Analytics Structure
1. **Performance Analysis**
   - Case-level performance metrics
   - Client and sponsor summaries
   - Work hours tracking and analysis

2. **Timeliness Analysis**
   - Due date tracking
   - Project progress monitoring
   - Delay analysis

3. **Resource Allocation**
   - Work hours distribution
   - Resource utilization metrics
   - Capacity planning

### Data Structures
We use dataclasses extensively for analytics data representation.
